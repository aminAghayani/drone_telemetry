# drone_telemetry
drone telemetry written by Qt

This code is wireless solution to observe, plot and  change variables and we use it in our KN2C UAV team drone

I wrote this code with Qt and it works with esp12 and stm32f4(where our controlling main code for our drones exists)

This tool could be so useful to set control loop factors like pid or a filter factors like kalman

Down below you can see a pid factors that has been set for drone altitude control
