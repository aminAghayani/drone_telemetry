# PID Setter and Telemetry
PID setter and telemetry written by Qt

This code is wireless solution to observe, plot and  change variables and we use it in our KN2C Robotic Lab

I wrote this code with Qt and it works with esp12 and stm32f4(where our controlling main code usually exists)

This tool could be so useful to set control loop factors like pid or a filter factors like kalman

Down below you can see a pid factors that has been set for drone altitude control
